# University of Helsinki and Upcloud
This fork is for the students in the course [Software Evolution and Reliability CSM14120](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/course-implementation/hy-opt-cur-2425-a69fc2f2-ee4d-4e1d-87c1-1e91c069c6c2) at the University of Helsinki. Visit the [course page](https://moodle.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=69095) for exercise instructions. Technical details are in [UH_Instruction.md](UH_Instruction.md), [uh_locust_tests](uh_locust_tests), and [UH_chaosmesh](UH_chaosmesh). Instructions assume you are running this project on the cloud provider [Upcloud](https://upcloud.com/). It will likely work elsewhere, but your mileage may vary.
